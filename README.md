### 🙋‍♂️ | About Me

Hey there! I'm Marijn, a developer with a strong focus on backend development. I have solid experience with the PHP framework Laravel, where I’m always working to innovate and refine my skills. I also do some frontend development, mainly using Tailwind CSS, but backend is where I truly feel at home.
